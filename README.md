# ❄️  NixOS configuration ❄️

My personal NixOS configuraiton file.

It contains hardware/software configurations for setting up my personal/work machines.
As of this moment, I haven't yet reached the point of deploying VMs using Nix, meaning that this configuration **IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY**.

Please don't try to copy-paste the configuration on your own machine and try to understand it first for the following reasons:
1. It simply won't work, due to the difference in hardware configuration between my machines and yours (for example gpu drivers, device IDs)
2. You won't learn much doing that, and later when you want to change something in your config it'll be harder for you to achieve that
3. This config structure is made by my personal taste, not yours ... and if some certain functionalities are either missing or badly implemented - then you would need to fork my repo and make your desired change in your version. Nevertheless, I'm more than open to suggestions for improvments so please feel free to open an issue!

Since I have just started using NixOS for about a month, the config structure isn't intensively using the Nix Builtin Functions and Nix Lib (excepts `imports`). This has an advantage an disadvantage. Advantage is that for Nix newcomers with some programming background, they can more easily understand the idea and practical implementation of the configuration within short amount of time. But the disadvantage is obviously the lack of customization and resolving some edge cases, like downloading a package, that's not present in Nixpkgs repository. 


## Used Nix features 

1. home-manager
2. flakes

## Structure

```markdown
.
├── archive
├── flake.lock
├── flake.nix
├── home
├── hosts
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── programs
├── README.md
└── wallpaper.jpg
```

- archive: not used in building the system. It stores the initial configuration of NixOS when first installed. (you can ignore this part)
- flake.lock: autogenerated file when building the system along with an argument of `--flake`. Used for pinning down the specific versions of the Nix dependencies, that are listed under *flake.nix*
- flake.nix: file, used for declaring all of the Nix specific dependencies/features (home-manager, nixpkgs). It is also the starting point for defining all of the the user/system environments
- home: used for storing all of the user environments (Joe's PC, Jane's PC, etc.)
- hosts: used for storing the hardware specifications of the machines (and also the specific options of the system wide installed programs, that part actually needs to be moved elsewhere)
- Makefile: automation script for aliasing the Nix CLI commands in a more user friendly way
- programs: contains the user/system type of packages
- wallpaper.jpg: background photo for i3wm

## Build instructions

1. Build the system for `personal/desktop` host: `make sys-update-pd`
2. Build the system for `work/laptop` host: `make sys-update-wl`
2. Build the user environment for `ikostov2`: `make home-update`

### References 

This section helped me better understand Nix package manager and Nix language.
Please have a read on them!

#### Jumpstart for using flakes && home-manager

I highly recommend that you read and follow this guide for migrating your initial `configuration.nix` to flakes/home-manager. It's easy to understand without any technical jargon and gets straight to the point.
