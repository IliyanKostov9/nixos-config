# ❄️ NixOS configuration ❄️

## 🚀 About

My personal NixOS configuration file.

It contains hardware/software configurations for setting up my personal/work machines.
As of this moment, I haven't yet reached the point of deploying VMs using Nix, meaning that this configuration **IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY**.

Please don't try to copy-paste the configuration on your own machine and try to understand it first for the following reasons:

1. It simply won't work, due to the difference in hardware configuration between my machines and yours (for example gpu drivers, device IDs)
2. You won't learn much doing that, and later when you want to change something in your config it'll be harder for you to achieve that
3. This config structure is made by my personal taste, not yours ... and if some certain functionalities are either missing or badly implemented - then you would need to fork my repo and make your desired change in your version. Nevertheless, I'm more than open to suggestions for improvements, so please feel free to open an issue!


## Used Nix features 

1. home-manager
2. flakes

5 directories, 8 files
```

- **archive**: not used in building the system. It stores the initial configuration of NixOS when first installed. (you can ignore this part)
- **config.nix**: An attribute set, containing all of the user and host tightly specific configuration, that is consumed by the home and hosts module
- **flake.lock**: autogenerated file when building the system along with an argument of `--flake`. Used for pinning down the specific versions of the Nix dependencies, that are listed under *flake.nix*
- **flake.nix**: file, used for declaring all of the Nix specific dependencies/features (home-manager, nixpkgs). It is also the starting point for defining all of the the user/system environments
- **home**: used for storing all of the user environments (Joe's PC, Jane's PC, etc.)
- **hosts**: used for storing the hardware specifications of the machines
- **Makefile**: automation script for aliasing the Nix CLI commands in a more user-friendly way
- **programs**: contains the user/system type of packages
- **wallpaper.jpg**: background photo for i3wm

## Build instructions

First you can check all of the available build scrpts by using `make help`
After that please make sure to replcae the `DEFAULT_USER` value from Makefile into your liking.

### 📝 Build 

* show available commands

```bash
make help
```

- build your home configuration: `make home-update`
- build your system configuration for work laptop (Thinkpad p53): `make sys-update-wl`
- build your system configuration for personal desktop (AMD): `make sys-update-pd`

- upgrade flake dependencies: `make flake-upgrade`

### Generations 

* user generations:
```bash
make clean
```

* system generations: 
```bash
make clean-su`
```

* optimise packages: 
```bash
make deduplicate
```

* show all generations
```bash
make show-gen
```

### References 

This section helped me better understand Nix package manager and Nix language.
Please have a read on them!

#### Jumpstart for using flakes && home-manager

>I highly recommend that you read and follow this guide for migrating your initial `configuration.nix` to flakes/home-manager. It's easy to understand without any technical jargon and gets straight to the point.
